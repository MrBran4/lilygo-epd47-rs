# LilyGo EPD47 Rust HAL

Highly experimental Rust HAL for
the [LilyGo T5 4.7 Inch E-Paper display](https://www.lilygo.cc/en-pl/products/t5-4-7-inch-e-paper-v2-3).
Supports only the ESP32-S3 version (Tested on HW-Version V2.3)

This library uses [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) for accessing the underlying hardware.

**WIP: Under active development, highly unstable and not yet usable :)**
